# litex-std
A repository for constructing Litex std. 

This repo provides **definitions, theorems, and proofs** across major branches of mathematics.  

Currently, we aim to **prioritize breadth over depth**: finish a usable core in a few fields first, then expand. See COUNTRIBUTING.md for style guides and task lists.
