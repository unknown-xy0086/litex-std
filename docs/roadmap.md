# ROADMAP
This is a roadmap for contructing litex standard libraries for different branches in Math. 

This document outlines the roadmap for building **litex-std**, a standard library for the Litex proof assistant.  
Our strategy is **skeleton-first**: we prioritize adding **definitions and theorem statements** early (even with placeholders), and gradually fill in proofs.

## Global Phases

Perhaps we may refer to mathlib4 in LEAN to see what we can do here in Litex. 

- **Phase 1**: Provide essential structures to support basic number theory, algebra, and linear algebra.  
- **Phase 2**: Add fundamental theorems from number theory, algebra, and analysis.  
- **Phase 3**: Enrich the library with combinatorics, probability, and deeper results in algebra/analysis.
